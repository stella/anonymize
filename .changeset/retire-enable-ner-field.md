Remove the deprecated `PipelineConfig.enableNer` field. The native pipeline never implemented NER and always rejected `true`; typed callers that still pass `enableNer: false` should delete the line. Untyped callers that pass `enableNer: true` keep failing fast through `assertNativePipelineSupported`. Configs serialized with the old field (existing prepared packages) continue to load; the stale key is ignored.
